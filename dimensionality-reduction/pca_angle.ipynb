    "# Angles Between Two Vector Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have big vector space $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^M$\n",
    "* Have two subspaces $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ and $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^L$\n",
    "* The subspaces are given by orthonormal bases $\\{\\vec{a}_i\\}$ and $\\{\\vec{b}_j\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "Find angle between the vector spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Find an arbitrary vector in each vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{p}_A(\\vec{\\alpha}) = \\sum_i \\alpha_i\\vec{a}_i$$\n",
    "$$\\vec{p}_B(\\vec{\\beta}) = \\sum_i \\beta_i \\vec{b}_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Impose the constraint that the prefactors are normalized\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_i \\alpha_i^2 = 1$$ \n",
    "$$\\sum_i \\beta_i^2 = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Define the cosine between the two vectors as their dot product\n",
    "$$C = \\cos_{AB} = \\vec{p}_A \\cdot \\vec{p}_B = \\sum_{ij} M_{ij} \\alpha_i \\beta_j$$\n",
    " Where $M_{ij} = \\vec{a}_i \\cdot \\vec{b}_j$\n",
    " 4. Use Lagrange multipliers to search for extrema of $\\cos_{AB}$ subject to the normalization constraints.\n",
    " \n",
    "$$G = \\langle \\alpha | M | \\beta \\rangle + u (\\alpha^2 - 1) + v (\\beta^2 - 1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\partial_\\vec{\\alpha} G = M \\vec{\\beta} + 2u\\vec{\\alpha} = 0$$\n",
    "$$\\partial_\\vec{\\beta} G = M^T \\vec{\\alpha} + 2v\\vec{\\beta} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u = v = -\\frac{C}{2}$$\n",
    "$$MM^T \\vec{\\alpha} = C^2 \\vec{\\alpha}$$\n",
    "$$M^TM \\vec{\\beta} = C^2 \\vec{\\beta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**\n",
    "$$C^2 = \\cos^2_{AB} = \\mathrm{eval}(MM^T) = \\mathrm{eval}(M^TM)$$\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\alpha} = \\mathrm{evec}(MM^T)$$\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\beta} = \\mathrm{evec}(M^TM)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "* The relationship between two subspaces can be described by a set of angles.\n",
    "* The number of angles is given by the size of the smaller of the two subsets. \n",
    "* For each dimension of the smaller subset that is contained in the larger subset, there will be an angle of size zero\n",
    "* For each dimension not fully contained in the larger set, there will be an angle determining the largest angle that dimension could form with the larger subset."
