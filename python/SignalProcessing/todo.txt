* Autocorrelation  - what does it mean
  - should decay for chaotic systems?
  - represents amount of recurrent memory? What kind of?
* Correlation matrix spectrum is PCA!
  - Look at estimators of correlation, see why its different in numpy
Periodigram
  - Look at two implementations (Welch and ??)
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_method
  - Implement yourself, try to understand how it works

What is SVD, how is it related to Eigendecomposition and PCA?
