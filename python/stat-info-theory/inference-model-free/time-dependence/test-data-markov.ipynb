    "Given a sequence of multivariate data, we want to determine if history has predictive power over the present. The question of interest are:\n",
    " 1. Does history length $k+1$ have more predictive power over the present than history length $k$\n",
    " 2. Is there enough data to make reliable statements about the effect of history length $k$\n",
    " 3. Is it possible to test for non-history changes - e.g. changes in observable distribution due to interactions with non-observable objects? Surely, under the assumption that external input is slow/weak/rare compared to observable behaviour.\n",
    " \n",
    "To start, it is necessary to define what predictive power means, and whether the it is at all possible to make conclusive statements in this regard. Concerns are as follows:\n",
    "* The proof of predictive power of length $k$ requires its assumption in the first place - isn't it a chicken and an egg problem?\n",
    "* In case of a discrete distribution, investigation of the full joint probability distribution will reveal all observable combinations of past and present values. If some of the theoretically possible "
