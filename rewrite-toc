TODO (Learn)
    * Frequency Analysis - PSD, Band power, Frequency domain
    * Singular spectrum analysis -> Taken's embedding, applies PCA to time lags 
in phase space to separate signal into stationary components
    * Correlation Dimension - Implement. Very beautiful concept
    * Recurrence plot - Implement. Seems very reasonable approach to projecting 
multidimensional data. 
    * heteroskedasticity models

TODO (Find Home)
    * ANOVA
    * Parameter jiggling to get smooth estimators (read pub)

Probability Theory
    - Moments
    - Empirical Distributions, CDF
Resampling
    - IID methods: Bootstrapping, Permutation
    - NON IID: (AKA Surrogate data)
Monte Carlo Methods
    - Expectation Values
    - Integrals
Hypothesis Testing
    - Parametric Tests
        - T, F, Chi2, Binomial, etc
    - Non-Parametric Tests
        - Ranksum/Signrank
    - Permutation-testing
        
    - Composing p-values
Inference: Non-parametric:
    - Static Relation metrics: Corr, Spr, MI
    - Dynamic Relation metrics:
        - Complexity (PI)
        - Stationary (CrossCorr, GC)
        - Semi-Stationary (TE)
